sqtracker is a modern private BitTorrent tracker platform.

It implements all of the features required to run a private (or public) tracker and does not focus on any one specific type of content. It is suitable for running a tracker site of any kind.

## Configuration

All configuration is provided via a single JavaScript file named `config.js`. This file must export an object containing 2 keys: `envs` and `secrets`.

An example configuration can be found in `config.example.js`. This file contains examples and explanations for each config value.

If your configuration is not valid, sqtracker will fail to start.

### The initial admin user

On first start up, sqtracker will create a user named `admin` with the password `admin`. A confirmation email will be sent to the admin email address you specified in your config file. Once logged in for the first time, you should change the admin password immediately. This admin user can be used to send other admin invites (normal accounts cannot send admin invites). This user cannot be deleted/banned.

## Deploying

### Components

An sqtracker deployment is made up of 4 separate components. These are:

#### 1. The sqtracker API service

The sqtracker API service handles all actions taken by users (authentication, uploads, searching etc.), implements the BitTorrent tracker specification to handle announces and scrapes, and provides the RSS feed. 

#### 2. The sqtracker client service

The sqtracker client service provides the modern, responsive web interface that users interact with.

#### 3. A MongoDB database

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular and powerful document-oriented database. Version 5.2 or higher is required.

#### 4. A HTTP proxy server

The HTTP proxy allows the client, API, and BitTorrent tracker to all be accessible via a single endpoint.

Traefik is recommended and is configured by default. An Nginx config file is also provided for those that prefer it and the `docker-compose.yml` file contains an Nginx block that can be enabled. 

### Deploying with Docker compose

The sqtracker platform is designed to be deployed via Docker. Once a configuration file is created, deploying is as simple as running `docker compose up -d` at the root of the project.

To get HTTPS working, you will need to change a few values:

* In `docker-compose.yml`: `--certificatesresolvers.tlsresolver.acme.email=` needs to have a valid email address.
* In `traefik.yml`: 2 instances of `` Host(`example.com`) `` need to contain your domain name.

If you change the name of any services in `docker-compose.yml`, you will also need to update the relevant host names in your `config.js` and `traefik.yml` files.

sqtracker is reasonably light-weight, but you should still invest in a VPS with decent resources if you want to run a fast and performant tracker.

### Deploying with a PaaS platform

Alternatively, you can deploy each service individually on a PaaS cloud platform such as [Northflank](https://northflank.com).

You will need to deploy each of the 4 components listed above. The Docker images for the client and API services are published in this repository.

## Adding a translation

New translations are always appreciated!

To add a new translation in your own language, create a new JSON file with your 2 character locale code in `client/locales`. For example, `client/locales/en.json`. In the `client/locales/index.js` file, you should then import your JSON file and add it to the exported object along with the existing locales.

The best place to start is to copy the `en.json` file and work through it, translating each English string.

There is also an [inlang project](https://fink.inlang.com/github.com/tdjsnelling/sqtracker) to aid with translation.
